Thanks a lot for installing googlecalendar for ruby ;)

If you are migrating from version 0.0.x to 1.0.0, you will need to add:

require 'googlecalendar'
** include Googlecalendar **

If you where using the 'builders' with:
require 'builders' # DEPRECATED
is replaced by 
require 'googlecalendar_builders'

For more information on googlecalendar, see http://googlecalendar.rubyforge.org
